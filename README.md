# Digital Rosetta Stone Key Website

This repository has the website infrastructure for the original master files for FileFormat.Info's Digital Rosetta Stone project.

Due to size constraints, some of the actual files themselves are not in git.  You need to download them directly from the website.

Files not in repo:
 
 * settlement
 * firstflight
 * adultschool

The [rosetta-www](https://github.com/fileformat/rosetta-www) repository is the website for [digitalrosetta.org](http://www.digitalrosetta.org/), which has thumbnails and human-readable descrptions.
