# Digital Rosetta Stone Key Website

This repository has the website infrastructure for the original master files for the FileFormat.Info's Digital Rosetta Stone.  

Due to size constraints, the actual files themselves are not in git.  You need to download them directly from the website.

The rosetta-www repository is the website for [digitalrosetta.org](http://www.digitalrosetta.org/) which has thumbnails and human-readable descrptions.
